__label__0 "this is just okay for me . the top is soft and surprisingly flattering especially from the side but the front rides up and the neckline never lays flat . it washes well and the tan/white combo is cute but a little transparent ."
__label__0 "i fell in love with this trench when i first saw it online but ended up returning it once i tried it on . i 'm 5 ' 9 140 lbs and the m fit true to size . but the belt hit above my natural waistline and the skirt of the coat was much fuller than i expected making me look heavier . the material also wrinkles easily and the stitching was poor quality with lots of loose threads . disappointed as the color and concept were great ."
__label__-1 "this top is huge ! i 'm typically a size 2 or 4. i bought the 2 and its huge . it 's wider than it is long . even if i sized down to a 0 it would still be too much fabric . i 'm so disappointed ! beautiful color and fabric but there 's so much fabric . i love a flowy top but this one is way too much . : ( i will be returning this top ."

__label__-1 "this looks like the perfect easy sweater with the white shirt appeal to it but sadly the fit of this number is really off . it looks more like a tent . it must have been clipped in the back or something . i can not see any scenario in which this would look good ..."
__label__-1 "this dress looked great on the hanger but once on it did absolutely nothing for me . navy is one of my most flattering colors but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt . that second color made me look drab . i am 5 ' 8 with a long torso and wear a size 12 in tts tops and dresses but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs . i really needed the waist to be dropped further . or higher"
__label__0 "i tried this on in the store and the colors and fabric are terrific . it 's very light-weight fabric but is n't see-through . the colors are medium in depth not too bright . if you typically wear cool colors and avoid browns you may be able to wear this because the brown is very muted . there 's two strings inside that you tie around your waist to pull the bust of the dress in . i 'm 5 ' 4 and 125 lbs so there 's simply too much fabric in the dress . i would have bought a petite . the tag says it 's avai"

__label__-1 "i really wanted to love these i bought them in a rush because i needed to replace my skinny jeans asap . they were a little long and did n't quite hug my calves but i figured with hemming they would be fine . i was told they would n't stretch out much . well they fit great at the waist but the legs are now huge on me and i ca n't get them to shrink . wish i spent a little more on a different skinny jean . too late to return so my hoping to be going out jeans are now lazy day jeans ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this . however the fit was funky and the colors were muted . this is definitely something you must try on in the store . too risky to buy online due to weird fit ."
__label__0 "these shorts are just beautiful . with that said they were expensive but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale ! they do also run large and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies . i will be bringing them back to my local store to ( hopefully ) exchange for a smaller size . fingers crossed that they still have them in stock !"
__label__0 "i had to return this because the lining is super short and uneven . its shorter in the back and falls weird . i love the color even better than the picture . but quality is lacking for this high price . i ordered the 4 petite and it fit but the elastic waist shows any bump in your tummy too . bummer"

__label__0 "i ordered this item when it was first advertised fell in love with the unique pattern in the top and could hardly wait for it to get here . however when i received the top i was very disappointed the fabric is cheap the sleeves are tight and the overall product is of poor quality and poorly constructed . needless to say i returned it ."

__label__-1 "but it just does n't measure up . first the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head . and once on the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky . unfortunately i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately . the material is really cute but the dress is n't worth the price / effort ."
__label__0 "absolutely stinning dress ! statement piece for sure however i will agree with other reviews that the bust is small and has no give or wiggle room with the side zipper ... one if those dreaded side zippers that you always fear breaking as you dress . sizing up would help but the waist then appears too big or bulky .. i am on the fence about whether or not it 's a keeper ... definitely perfect for the smaller chested . i usually wear xs size 2/4 the 6 zipped the 4 nearly did but would 've smashed . neverth"

__label__-1 "the cut of the top portion of the dress is off . i tried on the s in-store & it bunched up in the breast area . i ordered a sp hoping the petite would fix the problem - nope - still bunched up . for reference i am a 34b . i would have kept the dress and given 5 stars if it was n't for said flaw ."

__label__-1 "i thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top . when it arrived the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low . on me ( granted i 'm a pear ) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way . the only thing i liked was the color . back it went ."
__label__-1 "thought this would be a great dress for warm days but alas it fit like a sack . love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses . shame this did nothing for my curves . ordered an 8 usually wear a 10 and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders . if you can sport a loose swingy shape this is a great dress with nice detailing but sadly the shape did not work for me ."
__label__-1 "the skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it and was mostly white yellow and some red . the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me . the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return ."

__label__0 "this dress felt small in torso and waist and suffocating in sleeves ( i do have average athletic arms ) . but the shoulders were cut so wide that one side was falling off as i fix one shoulder another will slide down . the material is nice but since it is not lined it feels inexpensive disposable ."

__label__-1 "review title says almost all . add to that that it is age appropriate unlike other kedia dresses for the very young . just too cute for words . i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart . this however on an older woman looks ridiculous . i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets !"
__label__1 "could n't resist the polka dots ! very cute and stylish cardi . since i 'm short waisted this cropped style is perfect for me . i tried on the xs and small and while there was n't a huge difference i went with the small since it had a bit more room . it 's pricey so i waited for a sale to purchase !"
__label__1 "i bought this to give room for an expanding tummy - i 'm 6 months pregnant and this completely conceals the bulge . i suspect i will appreciate that in the spring when i 'm actually trying to hide my leftover belly ... it 's incredibly soft and the top is wide enough to cover a bra strap . the arm holes are small enough to cover my parts but large enough to be comfy . i 'm 5 ' 5 medium build and normally wear a medium but got a large given my circumstances . a medium would have probably worked normal"
__label__0 "i am so bummed . these jeans are the perfect weight totally distressed ( and torn ) in a way that looks like you 've owned them for years they flare out at the bottom of the legs just the right amount ... but there is one huge - or i should write small - problem : your thighs have to be incredibly small to get these pulled all the way on . -- -- -- -- -- i am a 27 in level 99 and ag brand jeans and a 28 in my other pairs of coh jeans and in mih jeans as well . i do not have an hourglass figure ( my shou"
__label__1 "i love this sweater . it has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe . i live in minnesota so a fashionable throw-on-and-go sweater is essential . this sweater fits the bill . i love how soft and warm it is the cocoon styling adds a fashionable element while the acrylic/nylon/wool material keep it functional ( warm and cozy ) . i love anything with pockets which this has . i somewhat disagree with the other reviewers who say this runs small or short . i did not find that to be true for me and i ordere"
__label__-1 "i ordered this in both an extra small and a small ... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width but was shorter in length than i would 've liked ( if it shrunk at all it would 've been unwearable ) . the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked but i decided to keep that one . the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i"
__label__-1 "i wanted this so badly to wear as a dress over a slip . but it is not cute or flattering when you put it on . it made me look 20 pounds heavier than i am and the fit was awful . i usually wear an xs in dresses at retailer and this swallowed me . i am petite but this is just waaaaaay too big . so disappointed because it 's so pretty ."
__label__-1 "the peplum for this time hit me in the middle of my rib cage not at my natural waist so it looked very odd when it flared out with the peplum so high up . i am busty so it 's possible this would not be the case for everyone but i generally can wear peplum tops with no problem . i was disappointed to return it the fabric was very nice and the concept behind the shirt was a good one ."
__label__1 "this dress is very pretty and would be nice for a summer wedding . you will need to go braless or wear a strapless bra . i am sending it back because as it runs very small . i am a 34a and the size 2 was too snug across the top ."

__label__-1 "this top arrived today and after trying it on i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is 100 % without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture . the fit is designed to be loose so i do n't think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down . i 've included a picture of how it fits naturally and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back . it 's still a cute shirt just not the flattering top i was expecting . i 'm debating on"
__label__-1 "runs extremely large . i got an xs and am 5 ' 4 115lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size 10-14 and is 5 ' 6 and above . very disappointed with the size . the quality of the fabric was n't great either . i wanted it to work so bad but just did n't !"
__label__-1 "i ordered this online and when i opened the package i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top . it is much nicer than a basic t-shirt . when i tried this on the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage ! also the overall length is listed as 27 long but i think that is the back of the shirt . the front of the shirt is very short on me ( i 'm 5'10 ) hitting well above my hip bones . if only this was much m"
__label__-1 "i thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on it is so big on the bottom it looks like a tent . i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big . sad ."
__label__1 "i love this dress for it 's unique design with the crochet features . it is super comfortable great for being layered without see through . i ordered a small though and it is still too large for me . i have been trying to decide on returning it since i love it so much . i 'd recommend sizing down for this dress . i 'm 5 ' 6 '' 135lbs and still needed an xs which seems a bit off . i guess i 'm used to retailer running a bit big but i miss judge this one and hate to deal with the mailing and worrying"
__label__1 "i worry when i have an elastic waist or something that resembles this but the dress hangs like a dream . no puffing out no gathers that you can see . it is not sheath but not a line either kind of in between hits several inches above my knees but perfect with some black tights for winter . i saw the note about grey have to try it on agin in daylight but i would say think black on the top light camel color on the bottom i am 5 ' 8 typically wear a size 12 and it was true to size for me the"
__label__0 "let me start this review by saying 75 % of my clothing is from retailer and i love them . my husband bought this sweater for me recently and it 's gorgeous but when i tried it on one sleeve was longer than the other . i went to the store and tried on several sweaters even in different colors and had the same issue . sometimes is was extreme sometimes is was n't as noticeable . it was noticeable to me however as i am 6 ' and sleeve length is super obvious when its too short . love the sweater as it wa"
__label__1 "the picture of this dress does not do the colors justice . they are a very rich green and pink which were a popular color combination in the 70 's . ( i was there ! ) it adds an authentic touch to this great peasant dress . the black and white embroidery on the bib gives it a modern flair . i am 5 ' 6 130 pounds and usually wear a size six in a dress . the small fit perfect . while the dress is billowy the square on the back pulls it in so it does n't fit like a tent . perfect for boots now sandals lat"
__label__1 "i got so many compliments from friends i bought another one in different print . packs and travels well . i 'm 5 ' 6 and a heathy 160 lbs carry my weight in the middle . this dress is very flattering and fabric feels like pj 's . also east to wear with regular undies and racer back bra . living in a warm humid climate it 's my new go to dress . the fabric is so stretchy that i found the medium a better fit instead of my usual large ."
__label__1 "taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model . it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it . i ordered the medium ( normally wear a size 8 ) and is a little long but goes with my personal style . i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home ."
__label__1 "love this top . work appropriate and dress down worthy . i also like the fact that it is not clingy around the waist . comfortable fabric ."
__label__1 "everything about this blouse is perfect - the color the drape the detail . so flattering and easy to wear . i just love it !"
__label__-1 "this dress has pretty colors . the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella . it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways . the photo of model is from side not the front . very unflattering on me ."
__label__-1 "i ordered these in both colors . the red is much deeper in person more like a burgundy than pictured here . these tees are very slouchy . if you wanted a more fitted look size down . these are very soft and very comfy and will pair well with ponte leggings and skinny jeans . the overall quality seems very good although they are thinner than i thought they would be ( they seemed like they would be thick and stiff to me based on the photos ) . -- -- -- -- -- overall these are very nice . but there is one is"
__label__0 "so this shirt is adorable . soft fun lays nicely ... but you should have your arms amputated and replaced with a barbie 's before you put it on . i do n't even have large arms the medium fit me perfectly but then like i hulked out the arms and there are now little tears at the seams . this was all very confusing and vexing as this shirt is otherwise perfection . i mean i 'm not a large ? but i guess if i want this shirt i will need to take it back and get a large otherwise it will be sleev"
__label__-1 "this dress is thin and completely see through . it is definitely not worth the price tag . would be really cute in a thicker material ."
__label__1 "i always chuckle when i see this dress because it looks so busy and so crazy with all the mixed prints i think it 's a lot of fun . not so fun to put on but it 's worth the trouble . i swear my shoulders are sore after manipulating this on myself . i also own the mona dress in 8p but i had to size down to a 6 for the melodist because the hips were not fitted enough and the back bloused out too much ."
__label__-1 "i ordered two sizes . when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin . both shirts were in the bag . the style is just okay . the shirt is extremely light weight . i was not impressed with the fabric . i am returning both . definitely did not think it was worth the price ."
__label__-1 "i bought this dress to wear to an out of state wedding . first time wearing when i tied the strap the pull through at the top of the halter broke with minimal stress . i sewed it back with a repair kit from the hotel but was worried the whole night the dress would not hold up . if this is all that is holding the dress on it should be more secure with reinforced stitching . beautiful material and comfortable ."
__label__0 "this top is adorable in style and fit . which is why it breaks my heart that i ca n't recommend it . the embroidery snags so easily when i wore it i ended up with several tears in the threads leaving the pattern a bit of a mess . it snagged on my rings my watch and my purse . i returned it because of this . it 's really too bad and i wish the design were printed on instead of sewn simply because it would last a lot longer ."
